what is an operating system?
an OS is a program that manages the underlying hardware of a computer. 


how does it work? whats the basic architecture and components of an OS?
Ok, hefty question but i got you. let's break it down from high to low level.

There is the OS, which is like the whole building or company, and then there is the Kernel which is the manager of the company.
The Kernel is the single first process that runs and continues to run throughout the lifetime of an OS. It manages all the other processes and such.
The other elements of an OS include the GUI, Window manager, Shell, etc.

Nice, let's go a bit deeper.

system table, system calls, user vs kernel mode, trap table and trap instructions, 
these are all abstractions to control the hardware
timer interrupts, how to control the processes? Limited direct execution.
virtual memory,
a process is a running program. 
virtualization of the memory. gives an illusion that each CPU has full access to the whole entire memory, when really they are working off of an abstracted layer.
