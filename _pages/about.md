Purpose of this blog is to provoke my own understanding of things and to learn by re-teaching. 

"There is surely no more reliable way to kill enthusiams and interest in a subject than to make it a mandatory part of the school curiculum" - Lockhart's Lament

What better way to take back control of my own curiosity and interest by making compeletely unrequired and ungraded blog posts about my school subjects, and maybe
even waste time just pursuing even more depth of a topic just out of pure curiosity?
